## Introduction
This post is really about exploring the latest Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) technology developed by Google for deep learning purposes and getting acquainted with its architecture.

The learning exercise was part of a Kaggle challenge wherein the task was to classify 100+ types of flowers using deep learning on TPUs. The main 

## Background on TPUs
Tensor Processing Units are "AI accelerator application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed by Google specifically for neural network machine learning". They provide superior performance over GPUs in training large neural networks and are estimated to run 27 times faster.
